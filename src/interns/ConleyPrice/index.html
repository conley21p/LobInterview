    <div class="text">
      <p>Hello! I am Conley Price a sophomore computer science major at Illinois State University.
        I have a 3.93 GPA and I am a member of the AI and Web Development club on campus. 
        Over winter break I built and wrote software(for flight controller) for my quadcopter.
        In my AI club last semester I learned how to train a neural network to tell if someone in a image is wearing a mask or not,
        This semester we are working on putting that trained model into a application.

      <p>
        I chose to apply for this position when I saw in the description "you'll have a rare chance to make a direct impact on our products."
        This excited me so much, I want to find a position where I can contribute and work with a team to accomplish real world projects!
        I am very excited for the oppurtunity to meet and talk with everyone at lob and learn more about the company.
